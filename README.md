## üìÅ File Structure

FULL

```json
"past": {...}
"present": {
  "0": {
    "day": {
      "short": "Sunny",
      "long": "No significant cloud development observed",
      "comment": "Perfect for outdoor activities!",

      }
    },
    "night": {
      "short": "Clear",
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

SINGLE (e.g. present weather)(Contains Single Weather Code Data)

```json
"0": {
  "day": {
    "short": "Sunny",
      ...
  },
  "night": {
    "short": "Clear",
      ...
  }
}
```

## üöÄ CDN Access 
#### Fetch all data 
```js
const response = await fetch(
    "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/w3nabil/wwjson/dataset.json"
);
const codedata = await response.json();

console.log(codedata.present[0].day.short);
```
#### Fetch Single Code data (Saves time)
```js 
const code = 0; // Present Weather Code 
const response = await fetch(
    `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/w3nabil/wwjson/mono/present/${code}.json}`
);
const codedata = await response.json();

console.log(codedata.day.short);
```
